Build a cutting-edge, AI-powered project management dictionary website named "Defineit" that serves as the ultimate resource for PM professionals. The platform combines instant AI definitions, community knowledge sharing, and personalized learning experiences in a futuristic, premium interface.

### üé® Visual Design Philosophy
**Core Aesthetic**: Ultra-modern, AI-themed interface with deep space navy (#0A0B1E) backgrounds, electric blue gradients (#4F46E5 to #06B6D4), and subtle purple accents (#8B5CF6). Implement glassmorphism effects, soft glows, and floating particle animations throughout.

- Weights: 300 (light), 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semi-bold), 700 (bold)
- Hierarchy: Large hero text (3-4rem), section headers (2rem), body text (1rem)

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack Requirements
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, authentication)
- **Animations**: GSAP with ScrollTrigger for advanced scroll animations
- **Scrolling**: Locomotive Scroll for smooth parallax effects
- **3D Elements**: Spline for hero section 3D models
- **Icons**: Phosphor Icons for consistent iconography
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with fluid breakpoints
